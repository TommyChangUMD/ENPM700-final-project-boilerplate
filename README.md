![CICD Workflow status](https://github.com/TommyChangUMD/ENPM700-final-project-boilerplate/actions/workflows/run-unit-test-and-upload-codecov.yml/badge.svg) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/TommyChangUMD/ENPM700-final-project-boilerplate/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/TommyChangUMD/ENPM700-final-project-boilerplate) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repo provides a template for setting up:

  - GitHub CI
    - `main` branch runs in a ROS 2 Humble container
  - Codecov badges
  - Colcon workspace structure
  - C++ library, `my_model`, that depends on other system libraries such as OpenCV and rclcpp.
    - The library is *self-contained*
    - In real life, we download source code of third-party modules and often put the modules as-is into our colcon workspace.  Of course, we make sure the licenses are all compatible.
  - ROS 2 package, `my_controller`, depends on a C++ library, `my_model`, which is placed into the same colcon workspace.
  - Establishing package dependency within the colcon workspace.
    - ie. the ROS 2 package, `my_controller`, will not be built before all of its dependent C++ libraries, such as `my_model`, are built first.
  - Multiple subscriptions within a ROS2 node all listening to the same topic.
    - Only one callback function is needed.
    - More efficient than to have N callback functions.
    - More efficient than to have N ROS nodes.
  - ROS2 C++ unit test and integration test.
  - Doxygen setup
  - ROS2 launch file
  - Bash scripts that can be invoked by the `ros2 run ...` command

This software uses the **Model-View-Controller** architecture. 
  - **Model** = `my_model` module (see [src/my_model/README.md](src/my_model/README.md))
  - **Controler** = `my_controller` module  (see [src/my_controller/README.md](src/my_controller/README.md))
  - **View** = Gazebo

## How to generate module / package dependency graph

``` bash
colcon graph --dot | dot -Tpng -o depGraph.png
open depGraph.png
```

## How to build and run demo

First, make sure we install the catch2 ROS2 package.
```bash
$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash  # if needed
$ sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-catch-ros2
```
Now, we can build our system:
```bash
rm -rf build/ install/
colcon build 

```
And finally, run the demo:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch my_controller run_demo.launch.yaml
```
example output:

## How to build tests (unit test and integration test)
We want to run tests with code coverage.  Therefore, we need to enable the code coverage option.

```bash
rm -rf build/ install/
colcon build --cmake-args -DCOVERAGE=1 
```

## How to run tests (unit and integration)

```bash
source install/setup.bash
colcon test
```

## How to generate coverage reports after running colcon test

First make sure we have run the unit test already.

```bash
colcon test
```

### Coverage report for `my_controller`:

``` bash
ros2 run my_controller generate_coverage_report.bash
open build/my_controller/test_coverage/index.html
```

### Coverage report for `my_model`:

``` bash
colcon build \
       --event-handlers console_cohesion+ \
       --packages-select my_model \
       --cmake-target "test_coverage" \
       --cmake-arg -DUNIT_TEST_ALREADY_RUN=1
open build/my_model/test_coverage/index.html
```

### Automate the previous steps and combine both coverage reports

``` bash
./do-tests-and-coverage.bash
```

## How to generate project documentation
``` bash
./do-docs.bash
```

## How to use GitHub CI to upload coverage report to Codecov

There is already a `.github/workflows/run-unit-test-and-upload-codecov.yml` file provided.  But we still need to create a codecov account.

Follow the similar instruction provided in the cpp-boilerplate-v2 repo:

  https://github.com/TommyChangUMD/cpp-boilerplate-v2?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-github-ci-to-upload-coverage-report-to-codecov
